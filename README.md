###### Objective
> Our projectâ€™s primary concept is to utilize [Kaggle Yelp dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) to predict user's attitude toward new business, for example, restraurants. That is, we are going to get Yelp user review data, use review texts to predict reviewer's attitude (namely postive or negative) toward business. When people talk about a new business, we can capture their words, fit into the model, then predict their attitude toward the business, have some quantitative understanding its quality via sentiment scores and thus evaluate its potential accordingly. Since business categories are highly correlated to reviews we are going to focus on bars and restraurants for now. The restaurant category is also the majority of reviews fall into. Our analysis showed that the results from bars and restaurants are very similar.
