    "#### Goals\n",
    "Our projectâ€™s primary concept is to utilize Yelp data (from kaggle) to rate new business. That is, we are going to get Yelp user review data, use review texts to predict review is **positive** or **negative**. When people talk about a new business, we can capture their words, fit into the model, then predict its rating, sort of understand its quality and potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Yelp Review Dataset\n",
    "We write a shell [script](https://github.com/annesjyu/m207_summer_2018) to select $10,000$ reviews for training, testing and dev respectively, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews. We keep only review text and stars columns, then binarize stars into target label: \n",
    "- if stars >= $3.0$, review is *positive*\n",
    "- otherwise, it's *negative*.\n",

      " ['Absolute ripoff and terrible customer service! I went here for a bachelor party as I was told it was an upscale gentlemen\\'s club. After the $50 cover charge we found the place went downhill from there. We had one of the entertainers lie to us in order to go into the so called VIP area with a promise of 1 full hour of performances and 10 drinks included for $450. Then we were hustled further by being charged a 15% service fee and a 20% gratuity at the VIP entry in advanced \"\"before\"\" even being seated. What a joke!!!! Once in there we ordered a round of 3 drinks and it came out to $80. We challenged this charge stating we were told the first 10 drinks would be included! A lie from our entertainer Mariah!!! After performing for about 15-20 minutes Mariah said she was done. What about the hour that was promised? She then stated it was only half an hour and it was \"\"her bad\"\". We were very upset at this point because we were basically robbed of $700 over the course of 20 minutes! I then called Nicole later that day to dispute the charges  her response was that we should not have trusted anything that their entertainers said or promised. She said that they were independent contractors and they could say whatever they want. Even though they work under Crazyhorse 3\\'s roof. I was like really? I couldn\\'t believe it!!! Then she had our VIP host Darius call me later that day. Another total waste of time!!! He offered me a 200 gift card to use at the club. Basically an admission of guilt. Why would he offer us a $200 gift card if we weren\\'t lied to? Plus that\\'s not even close to the $700 we were hustled out of. I made it abundantly clear to him that I had no desire to go back to a place that rips people off. I asked for a full refund that I felt I was entitled to. I even told them to keep the $80 for the drinks I was misrepresented about. He promised that he would talk to his boss to get back to me within 24 hours. Another Crazyhorse 3 lie. It\\'s been almost 2 weeks and what a surprise  no response from Darius. I\\'ve left him three voicemails and three text messages with not as much as one response. This place is a rip off and the customer service is a joke. Don\\'t waste your time  patience  or money. I should\\'ve read their yelp reviews before I went. Browse through and you will see that they consistently rip people off. Pretty awful business practices. '\n",

In another words, after we filtered the data set with business category restaurants and number of reviews for each restaurant, the star rating distribution remains the same. In the following, we randomly select 15000 from reviews with rating 1 (less than 10% of all reviews with 1 stars) and 15000 reviews with rating 5 (about 3% of total 5 star reviews). We use this random sampled data to explore the characteritics of the text and business sentiments."
